# Day 1

State of mind: Excited, Ready to go

I had a productive day coding before which helps a lot.

- Dusted off my AoC Account
- Created a new repo for [AoC 2023 on GitHub](https://github.com/stephbu/aoc2023)
- Invested in scaffolding, dusted off previous Utility class
- Upgraded my Mac to .NET 8.0 SDK
- Took an update to Rider 2023.2.3

Figure that most of the time I'll be writing at night on my Mac, with Rider as primary IDE.
