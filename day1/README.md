## Diary
State of mind: Excited, Ready to go

I had a productive day coding before which helps a lot.  Did some prework to get ready for AoC 2023.

- Dusted off my AoC Account
- Created a new private team for myself and new coworkers.
- Created a new repo for [AoC 2023 on GitHub](https://github.com/stephbu/aoc2023)
- Invested in some C# scaffolding, dusted off previous Utility class
- Upgraded MacOS to .NET 8.0 SDK
- Updated to Jetbrains Rider 2023.2.3

Figure that most of the time I'll be writing at night on my Mac, with Rider as primary IDE.
Rider does a great job of being compatible with VS/VSCode
