## Diary

State of mind: A little tired, but ready to go.
Got back a little late from dinner, but got started just before 10pm PST.

## Puzzle 1

Fairly classic record parsing and validation problem.
Wrote structs and parsers to populate the data, ended up getting some leverage from the investment later on.
Wrote functions to provide record validation. Used LINQ to power much of the data-loading and validation across the
dataset.
Job Done

## Puzzle 2

Leveraged parsers written for Puzzle 1 to load data, then wrote a function on the ```GameRecord``` struct to
provide "Power" calculation. Used LINQ load up the data, and aggregate results of power calculations
Job done with quick and concise code.

## Summary

Day 2 under my belt in less than 50mins. Probably easier than Day1 just because it was less ambiguous.
