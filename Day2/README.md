## Diary
State of mind: A little tired, but ready to go
Got back a little from dinner, but got started just before 10pm PST.

## Puzzle 1
Fairly classic record parsing and validation problem.
Wrote structs and parsers to populate the data, ended up getting some leverage from the investment later on.
Wrote functions to provide record validation.  Used LINQ to power much of the dataloading and validation across the dataset.
Job Done

## Puzzle 2
Leveraged parsers to load data, then wrote a function to provide "Power" calculation. Used LINQ to power dataloading, and aggregate results of power calculations
Job Done really quick and concise.

## Summary
Day 2 under my belt in less than 50mins.
